**SPA - Simple Page Application**

SPA is a basic experiment in building a Single Page Application using only vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It doesnâ€™t use any frontend frameworks like React or Vue â€“ just raw code to understand how SPAs actually work under the hood.

This project is great for learning or testing ideas, but it's not production-ready. Itâ€™s a sandbox to see how routing, rendering, and interaction can be done manually.

**ðŸš€ Features**

ðŸ”„ Basic client-side routing (using hash or history)

ðŸŽ¨ Minimal UI built with bootstrap

âœ… No heavy frameworks or libraries involved


**ðŸ“‚ Project Structure**
